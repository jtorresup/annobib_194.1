    annote = { This paper reviews derivative-free optimization (DFO) algorithms,
              focusing on their use in solving bound-constrained optimization
              problems without relying on derivatives. The authors create a large
              scale test set comprising 502 problems, and evaluate 22 software
              implementations of the 22 algorithms into direct search methods and
              surrogate model based methods. The study also compares DFO solvers
              with the global solvers TOMLAB/MULTIMIND and TOMLAB/LGO for
              problems of higher dimension and non-convexities. This paper is of
              particular use to researchers and practitioners wishing to gain a
              systematic and comprehensive overview of the DFO methods. It is a
              fundamental resource for the field of optimization and particularly
              for problems where derivative information is not readily available
              or reliable. Extensive computational results are given on the basis
              of problem characteristics to offer a practical guide to the
              selection of an appropriate DFO solver.\\ Derivative-free
              optimization (DFO) is a highly relevant topic of study to the
              survey of optimization methods of machine learning since it is to
              address the key challenges that arise from optimizing complex,
              non-smooth, or noisy functions when gradient based methods fail. In
              practice, high dimensional, noisy, or black-box functions are often
              encountered in machine learning algorithms such as deep neural
              networks and reinforcement learning for which obtaining derivatives
              is usually very difficult or even impossible to be computed
              directly. In such contexts it is especially useful that DFO
              provides an alternative focusing solely on objective function
              evaluations, without relying on gradients. Evaluation of DFO
              algorithms in large scale, nonconvex problems supports the
              application to machine learning optimization where successful
              algorithms need to achieve a good balance between computational
              efficiency and performance. DFO methods provide valuable tools for
              optimization in machine learning when traditional first or second
              order methods cannot be employed, as the survey shows how important
              optimization is in ML. },

              non-adaptive methods. The paper also explores the use of
              block-diagonal matrices to further refine learning while

              high-dimensional data and rare, informative features, which are
              essential in modern machine learning. Furthermore, optimization is

              of non-convex optimization techniques in machine learning, covering
              theory, algorithms, and applications. The authors emphasize the
              advantages of directly solving non-convex problems instead of
              relaxing them into convex ones, which often leads to faster and
              more scalable solutions. Key methods like projected gradient
              descent, alternating minimization, and the EM algorithm are
              discussed alongside their use cases in sparse recovery, matrix
              completion, and robust regression. These methods, despite the
              inherent NP-hardness of non-convex problems, have shown significant
              promise when applied to real-world tasks, particularly when these
              problems possess favorable structure.\\ The monograph is structured
              in three parts: introduction to non-convex optimization, core
              algorithms, and practical applications. Part I covers mathematical
              tools and basic concepts, while Part II delves into specific
              algorithms like non-convex projected gradient descent and
              stochastic optimization. Part III focuses on the practical
              applications of these methods in machine learning, such as low-rank
              matrix recovery and phase retrieval. The authors provide a
              comprehensive introduction to the theoretical underpinnings of
              non-convex optimization, making this work valuable for researchers
              and practitioners alike, particularly those seeking to solve

              learning is a method where machines learn to recognize patterns,
              while reinforcement learning teaches machines to make decisions by
              interacting with their environment. Together, these methods allow
              machines to learn from complex data like images or videos to make
              better decisions. The study also highlights the success of this
              combination in games like Atari, where machines learned to play by
              observing the game. The authors also discuss future challenges,
              such as improving these techniques for real-world applications like
              robotics.\\ This referenced study is highly relevant to the study
              on derivative-free optimization because both explore advanced
              methods for solving complex problems. Deep reinforcement learning
              (DRL) focuses on improving decision-making processes by learning
              optimal strategies through interactions, while this addresses
              optimization without using gradient information, which is often
              impractical in real-world problems. DRL's ability to handle
              high-dimensional data and complex environments is particularly
              useful when optimization problems lack clear mathematical
              formulations. The overview study demonstrates how neural networks
              can model complex input spaces, a capability that can complement
              derivative-free methods by offering alternative ways to represent
              and explore solution spaces. Combining DRL with derivative-free
              optimization could enhance problem-solving capabilities in
              scenarios where traditional optimization fails, making this a
              valuable foundation for expanding upon the techniques in the new

    annote = { The paper introduced a few novel key concepts in optimizing
              policy search for reinforcement learning. These concepts were (A)
              the equivalence between natural gradient and trust region
              optimization, and (B) the compatible policy search (COPUS) which
              utilized that equivalence. Concept A was possible due to natural
              parameterization of standard exponential policy distributions (e.g.
              Boltzmann, Gaussian). Moreover, to cover the case in complex models
              (e.g. neural networks), Concept A was combined with compatible
              value function approximation. Finally, Concept B was the product of
              the realization in concept A which produced satisfying results
              equal to the current state-of-the-art policy search algorithms in
              the paper's experiment. The experiment was running the algorithm in
              OpenAI's roboschool.\\ The findings of this paper brought about a
              big optimization win in simplifying the update loop and the
              reduction of the runtime for policy search and even further
              optimizations can be achieved in the cases where there are discrete
              actions. Furthermore, the parameterization and approximation
              methods applied have little to no effect on COPUS's performance in
              the experiment. Further works can leverage the
              realizations/concepts of the paper for a myriad of reasons (e.g.
              added optimization step in building models, applying concept A on
              other optimization problems). However, the only qualm one can have
              on this paper is the sheer amount of prerequisites the reader is

    annote = { In this paper, Martens discusses the challenges of training deep
              auto-encoders using standard first-order optimization methods, like
              gradient descent. He highlights how these methods often struggle
              with issues such as under-fitting and problematic curvature in the
              objective functions, which can hinder effective learning. To tackle
              these problems, Martens introduces a new approach called
              Hessian-free (HF) optimization. This method utilizes a sparse
              initialization strategy, which limits the number of non-zero
              incoming connection weights for each unit in the network. By doing
              so, it prevents saturation of the units, allowing them to work more
              effectively and differentiate better from one another. This is
              important for deep learning tasks, where clear distinctions between
              units are crucial for success.\\ Martens supports his claims with
              empirical results showing that HF optimization outperforms
              traditional methods on various datasets, including synthetic curves
              and MNIST. His findings reveal that HF can achieve lower training
              errors without requiring pre-training, which is often necessary
              with other methods. This suggests that HF optimization can
              efficiently handle more complex architectures, such as recurrent
              neural networks and asymmetric auto-encoders. Overall, Martens'
              study provides important insights into optimizing deep learning
              models, showing that efficient learning algorithms can
              significantly improve the training of deep neural networks. },
