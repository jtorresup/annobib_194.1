	          a reduced cost, making it more feasible for educational
	          institutions with limited financial resources. Adams and Hotrop
	          outline the necessary hardware and software components to create a
	          functional VR system while highlighting affordable alternatives to
	          high-end VR technologies. Additionally, they discuss how VR can
	          enhance the learning experience by providing immersive environments
	          that aid in understanding complex topics, such as data structures
	          and algorithms. Through step-by-step guidance, the authors
	          demonstrate how to build a VR system with commonly available
	          resources, stressing the importance of hands-on learning and
	          interactive experiences in CS education.\\ The article is relevant
	          to current research on VR in educational settings, as it
	          underscores the potential of VR to create engaging and effective
	          learning environments without requiring significant financial

	          an essential resource for institutions seeking to implement VR for
	          teaching purposes. Moreover, the study provides insight into both
	          the technical and educational aspects of integrating VR, which
	          could be beneficial for researchers and educators looking to adopt
	          or study VR systems in CS education. Furthermore, this research
	          paper supports the systematic review by demonstrating the
	          feasibility of VR as a tool for widespread use in education and
	          addressing the economic challenges that might hinder its adoption.

	          MYR features an integrated development environment (IDE) that
	          supports real-time rendering of three-dimensional scenes generated
	          by code. The platform aims to make VR programming accessible to
	          both educators and students. Notably, pilot testing with middle
	          school students demonstrated MYR’s strengths in accessibility and
	          real-time synchronization. However, it also revealed difficulties
	          with advanced coding concepts like functions, which pose challenges
	          for younger users.\\ Furthermore, the platform offers an engaging
	          introduction to coding and VR, with the authors concluding that MYR
	          positively influences student attitudes toward programming. Despite
	          some challenges, the positive feedback and sustained student
	          interest suggest that MYR could become a valuable educational tool.
	          In addition, this study is relevant as it highlights an innovative
	          method of combining VR and computer science education, while
	          addressing both the potential and challenges of immersive learning
	          environments.\\ Moreover, MYR builds on previous educational
	          computing and VR research, focusing on creating accessible tools
	          for amateur programmers. While the study's small sample size limits
	          the applicability of the findings, the real-time feedback and
	          insights from the pilot test provide valuable qualitative data. The
	          authors, partnered with prominent institutions in educational
	          computing, add credibility to the research. Thus, this paper offers
	          a meaningful perspective on how VR can enhance programming
	          education, demonstrating potential to connect traditional and
	          modern teaching methods despite the challenges. Overall, MYR
	          highlights the evolving role of VR in shaping future educational

	          While VR offers significant promise in transforming education,

	          understanding of how students learn through hands-on, experiential
	          environments.\\ This article supports the systematic review by

	          technology is thoroughly analyzed in terms of systems, input/output
	          interfaces, and software. The study highlights VR's potential

	          its many advantages while also addressing practical challenges.\\
	          The authors also discuss potential risks associated with VR, such
	          as the possibility of reality escape, privacy concerns, addiction,
	          and social isolation. Notably, this study, conducted over 25 years

	          goal of the research comparing the learning outcomes of a computer
	          game designed to teach computer memory concepts and a similar

	          motivation and effectiveness. The findings suggest that DGBL was
	          more effective in enhancing students’ knowledge of computer memory
	          concepts and increasing learning motivation than the non-gaming
	          approach. Although the boys were found to be more experienced and

	          differences were not that significant as both girls and boys
	          achieved similar learning gains through DGBL. Meaning that DGBL can

	          effectiveness.\\ The paper further discusses the benefits of
	          educational games in terms of achievement of curricular objectives,
	          motivation, and suggests more research on the impact of games in
	          the long term and game design complexity. Papastergiou underscores
	          the integration of gaming elements in educational software to
	          address the expectations of the students alongside their
	          educational requirements. She argues that a well-designed
	          educational-game can nourish critical thinking skills, problem
	          solving skills, and interpersonal skills since the game will make
