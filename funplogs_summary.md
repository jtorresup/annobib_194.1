The authors prototyped a game, FunPlogs, to teach about fundamental
programming concepts through visual scripting. This is in the same vein with Scratch,
however, it was developed with student collaboration in mind. The game's puzzles is
primarily made by the students themselves in VR. Meanwhile, solving these puzzles
involves a personal computer scripting with a simple visual programming language that
has branching and looping constructs. The game received positive review from its
participants and was perceived to be effective in teaching programming concepts.
A problem that is apparent in the methodology was small sampling size of the
pariticipants. Furthermore, VR was mainly used in building puzzles rather than being
involved directly in scripting, hence, students involved will need to switch
sides from time to time for both to experience scripting. Despite that, this paper
displays a promising possibility in the effectiveness of VR integration in a
game-based approach in teaching programming by providing a creation medium.
