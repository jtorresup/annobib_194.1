              specifically for hazardous manufacturing environments with
              restricted human presence. Hongyi Liu and Lihui Wang apply the
              principles of CPS through the use of a collaborative robot and an
              industrial robot by integrating them to control and operate through
              a lead-through mode without complicated programming as it requires
              guiding operators on the robots. This scattered HRC system uses
              four adaptive operational modes that offer a local collaborative
              robot and its counterpart, an industrial robot. It can be connected
              in real-time and see assembly tasks with model-driven
              presentations. According to the development of Industry 4.0, this
              application of CPS integrates computational and physical elements
              to create highly connected and responsive manufacturing
              environments. Experiments have confirmed that the system is
              resilient and able to perform tasks like radioactive or chemical
              material processing, in which it is hard for a man to access. In
              the last section, it provides clues on how remote HRC applications
              might be extended in hazardous environments and invites future
              optimizations for complex industrial tasks.\\ This paper
              contributes to the growth of robotics and IoT technologies by
              showing a remote human-robot collaboration (HRC) system for
              hazardous environments. In addition, it demonstrates how the IoT
              and real-time data can be applied to enhance robotic control,
              flexibility, and precision with the attachment of collaborative and
              industrial robots with CPS. Its system's intuitive lead-through
              guidance simplifies complex programming for usability enhancements
              within specific applications, and its model-driven display allows
              for remote visualization, which further increases the awareness and
              decision-making of operators. In line with Industry 4.0, the
              approach provides further enablers for intelligent, connected, and
              adaptive robotics, as new possibilities are opened up in the areas
              of automation of inaccessible and hazardous locations driven by
              IoT.},

              (CPPS) framework, integrated with the Message Queuing Telemetry
              Transport (MQTT) protocol. The authors, Garcia, Montalvo-Lopez, and

              communication between human operators and robots within
              manufacturing environments, aligning with Industry 4.0 standards.
              The CPPS framework enables seamless interaction by allowing robots
              to adjust to dynamic conditions based on real-time data inputs
              provided by human operators. Through MQTT, a lightweight messaging
              protocol optimized for IoT applications, the system achieves
              efficient and reliable data transfer between components, which is
              crucial for responsive manufacturing settings.\\ The study
              contributes to the IoT and robotics fields by demonstrating a
              robust approach to HRC that leverages MQTT for enhanced data

              beneficial for applications requiring high responsiveness and
              adaptability, such as complex assembly tasks and precision
              manufacturing processes. The authors highlight that this
              integration facilitates a more efficient and scalable HRC model
              that is accessible, resource-effective, and suitable for various
              industrial contexts where dynamic adjustments are necessary. Future
              recommendations include exploring MQTT's potential for integrating
              additional sensory inputs to enhance situational awareness and
              scalability in multi-robot systems, thereby expanding the use of

              regions of interest (e.g. water stress, phenotype problems) of an
              agricultural field. Their method involves using a distributed
              algorithm in controlling a number of unmanned ground vehicles
              (UGVs) for inspecting the identified regions of interest. The
              problem was mapped into a locational optimization problem where the
              field is represented as a directional graph where each node and
              edge has a weight value that the algorithm has to take into
              account. Moreover, their method involves optimizing a distance cost
              along with dynamic partitioning of the UGVs coverage regions using
              Voronoi partitioning.\\ On a high level, their algorithm relies on
              iteratively determining the coverage regions of the UGVs by
              calculating the current Voronoi partitioning on each iteration.
              Iteration is defined as the UGVs moving to a new node. This
              partitioning is used in minimizing a heuristic function that
              decides whether a UGV is responsible over a target node. A node
              here is the intersection that is created by a number of farm beds
              (that number is four in the paper). This heuristic function is
              defined as the summation of each iteration calculation of the
              distance between the target node and the UGV's location multiplied
              by a priority value of the node. Furthermore, this algorithm has an
              obstruction avoidance built into it. Any nodes or edges that have
              obstructions are weighted to some value which influences the
              heuristic function such that the UGV would avoid those edges/nodes.
              \\ Faryadi and company's paper is originally part of a bigger work
              that they were doing that proposes the use of unmanned vehicles for
              both sky and ground coverage of an agricultural field. This paper
              was focused on dealing with ground data collection and may be
              applied for other agricultural-related purposes as it is a generic
              algorithm that helps the robots to get to where they are needed to.
              The paper showcased an interesting use case of robots in the
              agricultural sector. },
