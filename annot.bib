	          fundamental programming concepts through visual scripting. This is
	          in the same vein with Scratch, however, it was developed with
	          student collaboration in mind. The game's puzzles is primarily made
	          by the students themselves in VR. Meanwhile, solving these puzzles
	          involves a personal computer scripting with a simple visual
	          programming language that has branching and looping constructs. The
	          game received positive review from its participants and was
	          perceived to be effective in teaching programming concepts. A
	          problem that is apparent in the methodology was small sampling size
	          of the pariticipants. Furthermore, VR was mainly used in building
	          puzzles rather than being involved directly in scripting, hence,
	          students involved will need to switch sides from time to time for
	          both to experience scripting. Despite that, this paper displays a
	          promising possibility in the effectiveness of VR integration in a
	          game-based approach in teaching programming by providing a creation
	          medium. },
